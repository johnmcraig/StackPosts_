# StackPosts_
> An imitation of Stack Overflow using ASP.Net Core, Vue.js, and SignalR.

## Scope
This is a project based on building a forum application as a proof-of-concept using Asp.Net Core and Vue.js, where users can create posts for questions and/or reply to those posts. The funtionality also exists to upvodte and downvote posts based on ratings.

Currently, there isn't any limit to how many times a posts can be upvoted/downvoted and anyone can perform the action, so Autherization and User roles need to be implemented to place limits.

## Setup
In order to test/use this application, you will need the following:
- Asp.Net Core 2.0 SDK, prefereably 2.2.1
- Node.js version 8 or higher
- The Vue/Cli
